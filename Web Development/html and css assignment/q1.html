         <ul>
         	<li><p> Born in Odisha in the year 1897, Bose was exceptionally brilliant and secured top ranks throughout his study in school and university. He completed his BA in Philosophy with a first class score in 1918.</p></li>
         	<li><p>He cleared the Indian Civil Service examination in 1920 in England. Later, he resigned from his civil service job on April 23, 1921 after hearing about India's struggle for freedom.</p></li>
             <li><p>Earlier, Bose had been a leader of the younger, radical, wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s, rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939. He was expelled from Congress leadership positions in 1939, following differences with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the Congress high command, after openly attacking the Congress' foreign and internal policies.</p></li>
             <li><p> During the period of 1921-1941, he was imprisoned eleven times in various jails due to his stand for complete independence.</p></li>
             <li><p>Bose believed that Gandhi's tactics of non-violence would never be sufficient to secure independence and advocated violent resistance.</p></li>
             <li><p>He established the Azad Hind Radio station in Germany and led the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia.</p></li>
             <li><p>Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagvad Gita was a great source of inspiration for him. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universal brotherhood, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform have had instilled a vision in him.</p></li>
             <li><p>On August 23, 2007, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the Subhas Chandra Bose memorial hall in Kolkata. Abe said to Bose's family, "The Japanese are deeply moved by Bose's strong will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule."</p></li>
